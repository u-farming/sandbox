# sandbox - aka idea inbox

Trying to collect initial ideas, questions, answers, solutions ...

- collect Q/A/... in this file, create trees of folders should it grow like [bamboo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo)
- file issues and find consensus on further, required repos somehow

# open questions

- why ask?
- how to raise [bastards](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=de&tl=en&u=https://www.spektrum.de/lexikon/biologie/bastard/7383)? (for more: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard))
- [reconsider git](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rcsintro) before proceeding?
- [Ripening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripening) monitoring -- impossible?
- too many container variants (use-case, size, open/closed, side/roof windows, mirrors, electricity, cooling, heating, paint, target product)?
